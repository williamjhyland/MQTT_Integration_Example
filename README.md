# What is MQTT?
The MQTT protocol is the de-facto standard for IoT messaging. Standardized by OASIS and ISO, MQTT publish/subscribe protocol provides a scalable and reliable way to connect devices over the Internet. Today, MQTT is used by many companies to connect millions of devices to the Internet.

MQTT decouples the publisher and subscriber spatially, meaning they only need to know the broker’s hostname/IP and port to publish or receive messages.

# MQTT_Integration_Example
## How does this module work?
The modules main.py adds the module to the Viam registry. The script MQTT_Integration contains the get_readings() method that a Viam sensor must fulfill. The module spins up a MyThread class to manage clients. The client created by the module senda a SUBSCRIBE message to the broker with the topic of interest in the configuration.

The modules on_message() method is called whenever the broker sends a message down to the client. This overwrites an internal attribute called message which is referenced whenever the get_readings() method is called.

Separately there is some basic logging on start up to confirm that subscriptions occured appropriately and the configuration is valid.

Run "bash setup_venv.sh" to create the python environment and install the requirements then reboot the device.
## Sensor Configuration:
### Parameters:
  * "qos": If the subscribing client defines a lower QoS level than the publishing client, the broker will transmit the message with the lower QoS level.
     - At most once (QoS 0)
     - At least once (QoS 1)
     - Exactly once (QoS 2) 
  * "topic": In MQTT, Topic refers to a UTF-8 string that filters messages for a connected client. A topic consists of one or more levels separated by a forward slash (topic level separator).
     - myhome/groundfloor/livingroom/temperature: This topic represents the temperature in the living room of a home located on the ground floor.
     - USA/California/San Francisco/Silicon Valley: This topic hierarchy can track or exchange information about events or data related to the Silicon Valley area in San Francisco, California, within the United States.
     - 5ff4a2ce-e485-40f4-826c-b1a5d81be9b6/status: This topic could be used to monitor the status of a specific device or system identified by its unique identifier.
     - Germany/Bavaria/car/2382340923453/latitude: This topic structure could be utilized to share the latitude coordinates of a particular car in the region of Bavaria, Germany.
  * "host": The broker’s hostname/IP
  * "port": The broker’s port
### Example:
{
  "qos": 0,
  "topic": "aranet/358151004965/sensors/6009F3/json/measurements",
  "host": "10.1.8.247",
  "port": 1883
}
